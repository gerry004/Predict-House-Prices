# Predict-House-Prices
A project to help me learn about machine learning processes and how they can be applied in the real world to predict housing prices.
- Cleaned and analysed housing price data with over 10,000 records.
- Compared the accuracy of 8 different machine learning models.
- Implemented the best machine learning model with an accuracy of 96%.
- Created graphs to visualise the results using matplotlib.

Tech Used: Python | pandas | sklearn | matplotlib
